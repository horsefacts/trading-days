## Technical Details

The NYSE holiday calendar and Daylight Savings start/end timestamps are stored as [data contracts](https://github.com/dragonfly-xyz/useful-solidity-patterns/tree/main/patterns/big-data-storage).

NYSE holidays were precalculated through 2123 using the Python [holidays](https://pypi.org/project/holidays/) package. Each 13-byte sequence encodes one year, which includes up to 11 holidays. Each holiday is encoded as 9 bits, 4 for the month and 5 for the day. A year may have 9, 10, or 11 holidays, depending on whether New Year's Day of the next year falls on a Saturday.

The start and end timestamps for Daylight Savings were precalculated through 2123 using the `calculate_dst.py` script in this repo. The data contract stores each start/end pair as an 8-byte sequence, encoding two 32-bit values representing seconds since Jan 1, 2023. These represent the exact start and end timestamp of Daylight Savings Time in New York, according to current [DST rules](https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/popular-links/daylight-saving-time-dst). (That is, DST starts at 2am local time on the second Sunday of March and ends 2am local time on the first Sunday of November).
